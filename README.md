# CNS-LAB-PROGRAMS

                 PART-A
Experiment No 1: Implement three nodes point – to – point
network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary
the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

Experiment No 2:Implement transmission of ping messages/trace
route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find
the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

Experiment No 3: Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set
multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different
source / destination.

Experiment No 4:Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes
in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance
with respect to transmission of packets.

Experiment No 5:Implement and study the performance of GSM on
NS2/NS3 (Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment.

Experiment No 6: Implement and study the performance of CDMA on
NS2/NS3 (Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.

                  PART-B
Experiment No 7: Write a program for error detecting code using
CRC-CCITT (16-bits).

Experiment No 8: Write a program to find the shortest path
between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.

Experiment No 9: Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server
program to make the client send the file name and to make the
server send back the contents of the requested file if
present.Implement the above program using as message queues or
FIFOs as IPC channels.

Experiment No 10: Write a program on datagram socket for
client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at
the server side.

Experiment No 11: Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to
encrypt and decrypt the data.

Experiment No 12: Write a program for congestion control using
Leaky bucket algorithm.
